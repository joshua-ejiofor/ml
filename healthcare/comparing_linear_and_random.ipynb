    "üîç Interpretation\n",
    "MAE (Mean Absolute Error) measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest has a lower MAE, which means it is more accurate on average for individual predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression has a slightly lower RMSE, meaning fewer large outliers in its predictions, but the difference is marginal.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Conclusion\n",
    "Both models perform similarly, with only slight differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is slightly more accurate on average (lower MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression produces slightly fewer large errors (lower RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest might be a better default choice if accuracy is your primary concern, especially because it captures nonlinear patterns and interactions automatically.\n",
